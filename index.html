                <div class="bl-content">
                    <h2>God's Most Important Commandment</h2>

                    <p> Most of the rules under Chapter 4 were based on the 10 commandments of God (e.g.  First of all, love the Lord God with your whole heart, your wholesoul and all your strength, 2 and love your neighbor as yourself (Matt 22:37-39; Mark 12:30-31; Luke 10:27). These are the foundations of building one's character in faith and morality.The tools for good works are short statements of how we are to live our lives as Christians, and therefore as monks. There is nothing in these first 45 verses that the normal Christian should not strive to live–and if the normal Christian strives to live this way.</p>

                    <h2>Fear the Lord Our God</h2>
                </div>

                <div class="bl-content">
                    <h2>Fear the Lord Our God</h2>

                    <p>"Live in fear of judgment day and have a great horror of hell." These are the last verses that we would find under the Chapter 4 of the Rule of Saint Benedict. We must fear the Lord in order for us to strive for a development in forming our faithful character. We must develop a deep horror of offending God, deep repulsion towards sinfullness. A sensitivity and disgrace to our ugly and ill-fated attitudes towards our Lord. We do this not to degrade ourselves, but to uplift our spiritual consciousness and face the reality as it will truly give us the desire to change our attitudes or personality towards God and His lovely creations.</p>
